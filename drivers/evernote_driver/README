Getting started with the Evernote driver
========================================

The Evernote driver create a notebook which has the name of your root parameter and encapsulate your files in Evernote 'notes' inside this notebook.
That's means that you can modify these notes (add text, modify the title...) but you cannot add other resources inside a note.

To add new synchronized files from your Evernote web interface or client, create a new note and add a file inside with "join a file". The file will be downloaded on onitu.

BE CAREFULL : WHEN YOU ADD A FILE FROM EVERNOTE, THIS FILE WILL BE DOWNLOADED IN THE ONITU ROOT FOLDER, IF YOU HAVE A FILE WITH THE SAME NAME, IT WILL BE REPLACED.

An example of setup.json:

{
  "name": "example",

  "entries": {
    "LOC": {
      "driver": "local_storage",
      "options": {
        "root": "example/loc"
      }
    },
    "EVERNOTE": {
      "driver": "evernote_driver",
      "options": {
        "root": "my/path/to/my/folder",
	"token": "my_token",
        "changes_timer": 10
      }
    }
  },

  "rules": [
    {
      "match": {"path": "/"},
      "sync": ["LOC", "EVERNOTE"]
    }
  ]

}
