Getting started with the Flickr driver
======================================

A Driver to synchronize your photos and videos with a Flickr account. This driver works only from onitu to Flickr (If you add some photos via your flickr web interface, they not be downloaded on onitu)

Run the get_tokens.py script in order to let Onitu gain access to your Flickr account.

The script will ask you to access a URL and accept the Onitu application.
At this moment, when you click the accept button, flickr redirect you on a page.
You need to copy the URL of this page and paste it in the script.
The script can now display your tokens !

You can now paste these tokens in your setup.json file and play with your new driver.
