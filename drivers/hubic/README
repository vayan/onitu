Getting started with the HUBIC driver
=====================================

Run the get_refresh_token.py script in order to let Onitu gain access to your
HUBIC account.

How works the get_refresh_token.py script:

Your web browser will be launched in order to let Onitu gain access to your Flickr account..
Then, you will be redirected to a localhost address.
There is a parameter (in the url) named code.
You will need to copy/paste it for the next part of this script.

The code parameter in the redirected url is after 'http://localhost/?code=' and before '&scope=...'

An example of setup.json file with hubic:

{
  "name": "example",

  "entries": {
        "hubic": {
              "driver": "hubic",
              "options": {
                    "root": "/onitu_hubic",
                    "refresh_token": "THE TOKEN RETRIEVED WITH GET_REFRESH_TOKEN.PY",
                    "changes_timer" : 60
              }
        },
        "local": {
              "driver": "local_storage",
              "options": {
                    "root": "/onitu_local"
              }
        }
  },

  "rules": [
    {
      "match": {"path": "/"},
      "sync": ["hubic", "local"]
    }
  ]

}
